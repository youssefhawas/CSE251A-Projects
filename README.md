# CSE 251A (ML: Learning Algorithms) Projects

## Project1 (Prototype Selection Strategy For K Nearest Neighbor)
* Project-1.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing both random prototype selection and my personal prototype selection algorithm.

* Project1.pdf : Project report containing the motivation behind solving the issue, as well as details on the implemented algorithm and how it compares to random prototype selection.

## Project2 (Coordinate Descent Learning Algorithm)
* Project-2.ipynb : Jupyter notebook containing both random coordinate descent as well as my personal implemented greedy coordinate descent algorithm.

* Project2.pdf : Project report containing the inner workings of the implemented algorithm and how it performs compared to random coordinate descent.

*These projects were implemented as a part of the CSE 251A (ML: Learning Algorithms) course in UCSD.*
